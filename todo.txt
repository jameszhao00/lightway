TODO:

- Room is warped ??

- Maybe integrate FastFormat

DONE:
- Check for NAN/INF in the render code
	lots of floating point errors... 

- When running the classroom scene, the thing darkens after lots of samples (even though initially it's all good). 
	Try running with 0 bounces... see what happens


- normal should never reach there with 0,0,0
	- fixed. caused by returning -1 as bool

- handling when normal is 0,0,1 or 0,0,-1
	- fixed. detect when rotation axis is 0,0,0 and manually set it to 0, 0, 01. Works because if normal is 0,0,1 or 0,0,-1 rotangle will be 0

NOTES:

- watch out when typing vec3 comparison code out. 
	- don't do n.x == 0 && n.x == 0 && n.x == 0
